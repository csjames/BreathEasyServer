That's why it can be helpful to imagine being with your friends using these three simple steps:<br/><ol><li><b>Sit comfortably and quietly</b> for a few minutes<ul><li>Imagine that you are sitting with your closest friend</li></ul></li><li><b>Think about how your friend treats you</b><ul><li>Do they care about how you feel?</li><li>What do they say to you when you're feeling stressed or down?</li><li>How do they help you when you're feeling stressed or down?</li></ul></li><li><b>Think about how you treat yourself</b><ul><li>Do YOU care about how you feel right now?</li><li>Do YOU say to yourself the kind and supportive things your friends would say?</li><li>Do YOU do the helpful things your friends would do?</li></ul></li></ol><br/>Taking time to imagine being with your friends can help to <b>show you the different ways you could be kinder and more supportive to yourself</b>. This <b>makes it easier for you to support yourself</b> when you're not feeling too great.<br/><br/>You may not notice feeling any different straight away after doing this.  But <b>doing this regularly lets your mind know that you care how it feels</b>.  This will help you to feel better when you're feeling stressed.<br/><br/><b>Click 'next'</b> to try out another way of being kind to yourself.</p>",
